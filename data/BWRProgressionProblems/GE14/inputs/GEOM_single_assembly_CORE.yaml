# Geometry description for an axially varying simplified BWR assembly used as equivalent core.
# The power dominated region (DOM) is taken to be from 0.0 to 222.0595 cm (value from BWRProgressionProblems),
# The vanished rods region (VAN) is taken to be from 222.0595 cm to 347.1291 cm (value from BWRProgressionProblems).
# This file describes 2D core layout and the the axial variation using
