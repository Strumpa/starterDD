### starterDD
# A starter pack for Donjon&Dragon neutron transport / deterministic open-source codes
# Dragon and Donjon are part of the Version5 environment developped at Polytechnique Montréal and hosted on the OECD/NEA gitlab : https://git.oecd-nea.org/dragon/5.1 

# StarterDD is a python package which helps users get a more user friendly experience with using Dragon and Donjon. 
# The main modules are : 
- GeometryBuilder : uses the GLOW application developped by newcleo, avaialble at https://github.com/newcleo-dev-team/glow for surface element geometry definition of complex lattice geometries.

# To be implemented : 
- full "abstract" reactor model to support multi-physics
- python to CLE-2000 generator : create a full Dragon&Donjon case from the python model and generate equivalent CLE-2000 instructions to run.
